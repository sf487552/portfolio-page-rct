                    for all types of users. I am currently earning my certification in full stack development at the University of Pennsylvania where I have cultivated my skills in Javascript, CSS, and HTML. Years of creative problem solving have helped me to develop a unique perspective which allows me to develop original, eye-catching and intuitively designed web tools that keeps users engaged. Creative design projects come naturally to me thanks to the skills Iâ€™ve developed as a successful artist, music producer, and sound engineer with a diverse portfolio of projects that have seen success across the globe in over 85 different countries. My communication skills have also blossomed over the years as I've created a body work that translates easily and can be enjoyed by a diverse audience from all walks of life. I look forward to using my unique skills to develop innovative web pages and platforms for my users!"
